# Wireless_EV_Charge_Simulation
Inductive charging simulation for electrical vehicles on Simulink on MATLAB.
Monophase AC is converted into DC to later be converted into AC with higher frequency which decrease the energy loss in wireless energy transfer between the transmitter and the receiver coil. After high frequency AC is transferred to the vehicle, it is converted into DC to charge batteries.
Because the method is inductive charging, transmitter and receiver coils are accompanied with correspondent capacitive components for compensation purposes.
